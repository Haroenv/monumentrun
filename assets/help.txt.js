export default `Hey there and welcome to Monument Run. Monument Run was originally made for the React Riot online hackathon in the end of June 2017. It was then ported to React Native â€” and mostly rethought in July and August. 

You need to have an account, which is automatically generated if you log in. With the website (monumentrun.org) this is possible with Google or GitHub, on this app only via Facebook.

If you're logged in, you can start a 15 minute race on the left tab bar. During that time you need to walk towards as many monuments as possible and take a picture. This then gives you your score. 

You can compare how you did on the leaderboard.`;
